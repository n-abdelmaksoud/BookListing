# BookListing
BookListing App is my project on Udacity Android Networking

https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-networking--ud843

This project allows the user to enter a keyword,choose the type of book, choose the category to search by it, press the search button, and recieve a list of published books which relate to that keyword and his choises.

To achieve this, the App uses the Google Books API. This is a well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format.


Concepts used on this App:

1- Building an AsyncTaskLoader subclass that queries the API.

2- Parsing the result into a JSONObjects and JSONArrays to save the retrieved data on a custom class.

3- Using the ListView and ArrayAdapter pattern to populate a list on the user's screen with the information saved on the custom objects created earlier.
